        <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
        <p>Dear Eileen,<br><br>

            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br>
            of your <abbr title=""> PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    </dir>

    <dir>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
            could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="#"> important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
            
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
            by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Turning H0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C}4H) 703.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 3 x 104.)</li>
            <li><abbr title="">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd style="margin-left: 2%;">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around <br>
            ina circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
        </dl>


        <dl>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd style="margin-left: 2%;">Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
            tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
            modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
        </dl>


        <dl>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd style="margin-left: 2%;">An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
                discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
                of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
                because they were really cold.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page</a>.</p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
